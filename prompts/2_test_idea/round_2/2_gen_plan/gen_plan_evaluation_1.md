<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Semantic Coherence Distance for Readability Assessment
hypothesis: >-
  Text readability has a semantic coherence component that can be measured by computing distances between sentence embeddings
  in a semantic trajectory, capturing aspects of reading difficulty not reflected in surface-level readability formulas. However,
  this semantic distance signal may be complementary to rather than a replacement for traditional surface-based metrics, and
  its effectiveness depends critically on the choice of embedding space and evaluation dataset.
motivation: >-
  Current readability formulas (Flesch-Kincaid, etc.) rely on surface features like sentence length and word complexity, missing
  the dynamic flow of meaning. Information-theoretic approaches (compression/Kolmogorov complexity) capture static complexity
  but not the cognitive effort of semantic navigation. By treating text as a dynamical system trajectory through semantic
  space and measuring the optimal control energy needed to follow it, we can capture a fundamental aspect of readability:
  how much cognitive 'work' a reader must expend to track the evolving meaning.
assumptions:
- >-
  Text can be meaningfully represented as a trajectory in a continuous semantic embedding space
- >-
  Human reading comprehension requires cognitive resources proportional to the 'control effort' needed to track semantic changes
- >-
  Optimal control theory provides a valid framework for quantifying the minimum effort needed to navigate semantic transitions
- >-
  The energy cost of semantic transitions correlates with subjective reading difficulty
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Map sentences to embeddings (using SBERT or similar) to create a semantic trajectory. 2. Model the trajectory as a dynamical
  system: x(t+1) = x(t) + u(t) + noise, where x is the semantic state and u is the 'control input'. 3. Compute the LQR (Linear
  Quadratic Regulator) cost: sum of squared deviations from optimal path + control effort. 4. Alternative: compute the cumulative
  Wasserstein distance or semantic 'work' along the trajectory. 5. Compare against traditional readability formulas and human
  judgments on standard datasets (CLEAR corpus, WeeBit, etc.). 6. Evaluate whether SCE captures aspects of readability that
  traditional formulas miss (e.g., texts with simple words but jarring topic shifts).
success_criteria: >-
  1. SCE scores should correlate with human readability judgments at least as well as traditional formulas (Flesch-Kincaid,
  SMOG). 2. SCE should better predict reading comprehension scores than surface-based formulas on texts with simple vocabulary
  but poor semantic flow. 3. Ablation studies should show that the 'energy' component (penalizing large semantic jumps) is
  necessary for predictive power. 4. The method should be computationally feasible: <1 second per document on standard hardware.
related_works:
- >-
  Kolmogorov complexity using compression (Ehret 2018): Also uses information theory but measures static complexity of entire
  text rather than dynamic semantic navigation cost. Our approach is fundamentally different - we measure the optimal control
  energy of the semantic trajectory, not compression ratio.
- >-
  Bigram Semantic Distance (Kenett et al. 2017): Measures semantic distance between consecutive words/sentences. Our approach
  extends this by considering the optimal control effort over the ENTIRE trajectory (not just pairwise distances) and incorporates
  a dynamical systems framework.
- >-
  Coh-Metrix and coherence measures: Measure local coherence and connectivity. Our approach is global - measuring the total
  'energy' needed to follow the semantic flow, which captures both local coherence and global trajectory smoothness.
- >-
  Word Mover's Distance (Kusner et al. 2015): Uses optimal transport for document similarity. Our approach is different: we
  measure the control energy needed to follow a trajectory, not the transport cost between two static distributions.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis combines insights from three distant fields: (1) Control Theory - specifically Linear Quadratic Regulator
  (LQR) theory which minimizes energy for trajectory tracking, (2) Optimal Transport theory - which provides Wasserstein distance
  for measuring semantic transition costs, and (3) Physics/Dynamical Systems - which views readability as the 'work' required
  to move through semantic space. The core insight is that readable text should have a 'smooth' semantic trajectory requiring
  minimal control corrections, analogous to how a well-designed controller keeps a system on a desired path with minimal energy
  expenditure.
terms:
- term: Semantic Trajectory
  definition: >-
    The path traced by sequential units of text (sentences or paragraphs) when mapped to a continuous vector space representing
    meaning (e.g., through sentence embeddings).
- term: Control Energy
  definition: >-
    In control theory, the cumulative effort (measured as squared control inputs) required to make a system follow a desired
    trajectory. In our context, it represents the cognitive work needed to track semantic changes in text.
- term: LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator)
  definition: >-
    An optimal control method that finds the control inputs minimizing a quadratic cost function of state deviations and control
    effort, commonly used in engineering to design stable, efficient controllers.
- term: Semantic Embedding Space
  definition: >-
    A high-dimensional vector space where words, sentences, or documents are mapped such that semantic similarity corresponds
    to geometric proximity (e.g., cosine similarity in the embedding space).
- term: Optimal Transport (Wasserstein Distance)
  definition: >-
    A mathematical framework for measuring the distance between probability distributions by computing the minimum 'cost'
    to transform one distribution into another, often visualized as moving 'mass' from one configuration to another.
summary: >-
  This hypothesis proposes a novel readability metric based on control theory: readable text requires minimal 'control energy'
  to follow its semantic trajectory. By modeling text as a dynamical system in embedding space and computing the optimal control
  cost, we can quantify readability as the cognitive work needed for semantic navigation.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Narrowed from grand control theory claims to testable semantic distance metric, same goal of capturing coherence.
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Removed unsound control theory framing; SCD is now a simple heuristic metric, not derived from optimal control
- >-
  Acknowledged that measuring semantic coherence via embeddings is not novel (Coh-Metrix, etc.)
- >-
  Narrowed claims: SCD may be complementary to traditional formulas, not necessarily superior
- >-
  Added requirement to evaluate on real datasets (CLEAR, OneStopEnglish) not just synthetic data
- >-
  Added honesty about negative results: original experiment showed anti-correlation on synthetic data
- >-
  Removed LQR dynamical systems formulation that was not actually implemented or mathematically justified
- >-
  Changed 'control energy' terminology to 'semantic coherence distance' to avoid misleading claims

title: Semantic Control Energy Readability Scoring
summary: >-
  Implemented Semantic Control Energy (SCE), a novel readability metric based on control theory that models text as a dynamical
  system trajectory in embedding space. The method computes the energy needed to track semantic transitions between sentences.
  Implemented baselines: Flesch-Kincaid, SMOG, and Coleman-Liau readability formulas. Experiment on synthetic dataset (21
  examples with varying readability levels) shows SCE achieves moderate positive correlation (Pearson r=0.43) with true grade
  levels, while traditional metrics achieve strong correlation (r>0.95). Processing time is <1ms per document. The output
  includes method.py implementation and method_out.json results in valid exp_gen_sol_out schema format with full/mini/preview
  versions.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EVALUATION executor scope:
  Output: eval_out.json with evaluation results
  DOES: Any evaluation of experiment results — metrics, statistical tests, ablations, comparisons, visualizations, robustness checks, error analysis, etc.
  DOES NOT: Implement new methods (use EXPERIMENT), collect data (use DATASET)
  This is for analyzing experiment outputs from any angle
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EVALUATION: Must depend on at least one EXPERIMENT. Focus on statistical rigor and validity checks.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for evaluation artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

The agent loaded the **aii-web-tools** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````
---
name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: web search (Serper/Google), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — Serper.dev for search, html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and
   regex grep over the full document text. They work without any built-in web
   tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (Serper.dev / Google)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. Use it first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

## Contents

- Workflow (2-phase model discovery and calling)
- Scripts (Search, Get Params, Call)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Workflow: Model Discovery and Calling

### Phase 1: Search for Models
Find models with pricing, context length, and descriptions
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_search_llms.py "claude" --limit 5
```

### Phase 2 (optional): Get Model Parameters
Check what parameters a specific model supports
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_get_llm_params.py "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5"
```

### Phase 3: Call Model
Call a model using the API name from search results
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_call_llms.py --model "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5" --input "What is 2+2?"
```

---

## Scripts

### Search OpenRouter models (aii_or_search_llms.py)

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_search_llms.py "claude" --limit 5
```

**Parallel execution (multiple queries):**

IMPORTANT: When running multiple searches, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash

export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_search_llms.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S {} --limit 5' ::: 'claude' 'gpt' 'gemini'
```

**Example output:**

- Extra model-specific parameters as JSON string
- Use `aii_or_get_llm_params.py` to see which params a model supports
- Example: `--params '{"top_k": 50, "seed": 42, "frequency_penalty": 0.5}'`

`--timeout` (optional)
- Request timeout in seconds (default: 120)

**Examples:**

Simple call:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_call_llms.py \
  --model "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4" \
  --input "Write a haiku about coding" \
  --temperature 0.8
```

With system instructions:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_call_llms.py \
  --model "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5" \
  --input "Explain recursion" \
  --instructions "You are a helpful programming tutor. Keep explanations concise."
```

With reasoning (for o1-style models):
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_call_llms.py \
  --model "openai/o1" \
  --input "Solve this complex math problem" \
  --reasoning high
```

With web search:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_call_llms.py \
  --model "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4" \
  --input "What are the latest AI news?" \
  --web-search 10 \
  --max-tokens 15000
```

With extra model-specific params:
```bash
# Step 1: Check what params the model supports
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_get_llm_params.py "meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct"
# Shows: frequency_penalty, top_k, seed, min_p, etc.

# Step 2: Call with those params
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_call_llms.py \
  --model "meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct" \
  --input "Write a short poem" \
  --params '{"top_k": 50, "seed": 42, "frequency_penalty": 0.5}'
```

## Tips

- Use `aii_or_search_llms.py` first to find models, then copy `API` field for `--model`
- Use `aii_or_get_llm_params.py` to check what params a model supports before using `--params`
- For web search, increase `--max-tokens` to handle larger responses (15000+)

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

name: aii-web-research-tools
description: "Comprehensive web research toolkit — use whenever a task needs MORE than a handful of WebSearch/WebFetch calls (multi-source literature reviews, deep verification across many pages, paper/PDF mining, cross-referencing claims, building bibliographies). Not for single quick lookups — use raw WebSearch/WebFetch for those. Adds aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact regex extraction over HTML or PDFs (arXiv, journals) with context windows, beyond what WebFetch's lossy summary returns. Trigger: any extensive/comprehensive/deep research task, literature review, multi-source investigation, verify many citations, arxiv, paper, PDF, exact quote, methodology, table value, regex."

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.
   Key params: pattern (required), max_matches (default 20), context_chars (default 200 per side).

**Workflow:** WebSearch → WebFetch for gist → aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact details or PDFs.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-research-tools"
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
